	<h3>How can framing your project in a story format help you refine your ideas?</h3>
	<ul> 
<li> Stories use the structure (beginning, middle, end) that can be used to create a captivating experience for users. 
	If there is a strong story line, the audience can resonate-- they become invested in the product. The way we can get good user 
	interaction is by looking at it as a story first. People subconsciously have a certain idea of what general good design is and how it looks. 
	By framing my project as a story, it will help simplify my scattered ideas, keep user experience as a primary concern, and provide a clear project idea so that 
	I can create an efficient website for users to enjoy without poor design.</li>

	<h4> What are different ways to establish hierarchy in typography design?</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Hierarchy can be used to create well-designed UX/UI. It can assist in constructing a "clear visual path" by reminding 
		the designer to make the most important text get the most attention-- simamliarly, as the reading states, like a spouse. </li>
</ul>
