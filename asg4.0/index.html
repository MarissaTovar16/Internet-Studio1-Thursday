<h1> My Least Favorite Artist</h1>

<h2> I would say Taylor Siwft is my least favorite music artist. I personally think all of her music sounds the same and is too radio-esque. The production of her songs lack creative style, in my opinion. I do like maybe one song which is "You Belong With Me" because it is nostalgic. I used to watch it on MTV when I was a kid with my cousin during sleepovers. T swizzle is like unseasoned chicken. This is my personal opinion:) haha... </h2>
