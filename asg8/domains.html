	<h1>THREE DOMAIN NAME IDEAS</h1>
	<p>
		<ul>
<li> SpideyMars</li>
<li> MxrsMade </li>
<li> dropperz (like draw + perspective) hehe</li>	
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Discussion with Classmate Pt.1</h2>
	<p>My partner and I first discussed my first two domain name choices. I explained how these were 
		personal usernames I have used previously. My classmate liked them but thought that the title had nothing to 
	do with my website, therefore making it a weak domain name. Rather, I needed to try to go for something having 
		to do more with my concept of perspective drawing. Initially, I had this in mind. I believed that I could 
	go for a personal name that would reference me, the creator of the website. But after this discussion with my partner, I realized I
	could be more creative and think of something more punchy and unique.</p>
	<h3>Discussion with my Classmate Pt.2</h3>
	<p>Out of the three, my classmate was mostly impressed by my last option, which is now my first. The name "Dropperz"
	orginated from when I combined the word "draw" and "perspective" together. I took draw and the first four letters of perspective to 
	come up with "DrawPers" but thought that was boring. Then I thought it sounded just like "droppers", dropped the "s" and replaced
	it with a "z". My classmate thought it was clever and said it would be the best fit for my
	site. Though it is not obvious for my site what exaclty it means, my classmate suggested I add a tag line to go with it like 
		"Dropperz: draw with perspective or where drawing meets perspective". I liked this idea. We believed that the 
	domain name has a cool tone to it and it would appeal to a younger more beginner audience interested in learning perspective drawing. </p>
