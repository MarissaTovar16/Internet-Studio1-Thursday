	<h1>Advantages and Disadvantages of Sketching over Software </h1>
	<p>From The Guide to Wireframing, sketching a wireframes pros include speed, the ability to draw a wireframe quickly on a piece of paper, flexibility, and limited distractions, becuase there are no additives like font, color or any styling components to get in the way of sketching a wireframe. On the other hand, things like low fidelity, non-interaction,limited collaberation, and no version control stand as cons to sketching wireframes. They are not as neat and organized, and the ability to edit is taken away. </p>

	<h2> The best wireframing style for me:</h2>
	<p>The best option for my project would be to use software to create wireframes, which I did. Sketching could help me kind of get a rough idea of what I want my website to look like. I would then transfer those ideas to software wireframing to better depict how every component I would like to include. Things like buttons, boxes, pictures, and paragraphs would appear nicely in comparison to a sketch. If I chose a sketch it would be more time consuming because I would spend majority of the time focusing on perfecting the composition. I think software wireframing is more efficient.  </p>
