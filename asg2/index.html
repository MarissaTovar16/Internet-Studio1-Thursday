	<h2>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Structured content is planned and organized. It is content legiblly constructed outside for the interface. Semantic HTML is the elements within the language that communicates the information.</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>How do they work together?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The semantic elements make up the structured content. But, not so much for stylistic purposes. Rather, it serves as organized elements in a system that translates it to a visual/legible site. </li>
		</ul>
	<h2>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>It is important to be able to easily read your code. Not only does it help legibility of the site, but if done well, can also assist algorithms.</li>
		</ul>

				<h3>Required Reading Questions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Personally, the most successful way to get rid of that inner critic, would be to turn antagonism into partnership. If I can take that inner critic and make some use of it, that is try to be more creative as well as most effective in communicating my information, I am sure I can make something innovative and better out of it. </li>
				<li> David McRaney states that hyperbolic discouting is "the tendency to get more rational when you are forced to wait". In other words, hyperbloic discounting 
				is when someone considers a short term reward greater than a long term one. One example given by McRaney, is choosing to organize a desktop rather than completing
				a task due in a month for a job.</li>
				<li>The control and/or power I have over my website is limited but will be published for anyone to see. My limitations include my knowledge, and lack thereof, of coding considering this is very new to me. 
				However, I do have control over design as well as information over my topic which is perspective drawing and how to help people. I know that information specifically, and communcating that using code will be my toughest challenge.</li>
