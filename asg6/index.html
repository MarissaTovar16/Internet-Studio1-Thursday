    <h1>Six Thinking Hats Summary</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="Greenhat.png" alt="Dominant Thinking Hat" class="hat-image" />
      Here is how I implemented the hats, discussed with my partner, to my project website. 
    </p>

    <h2>The Six Hats</h2>

    <h3>White Hat</h3>
    <p>The information I have is knowledge about perspective drawing. Though, I will need to learn how exactly I can explain it in a way that is “fun”. I can get more information on the best way to teach through youtube videos and friends who are also skilled in drawing, like my partner. I also need more information about coding. I have learned a lot this semester, but, I know I will probably need help making my vision of the website. </p>

    <h3>Red Hat</h3>
    <p>My partner and I discussed ideas regarding feelings that could be associated with the UX of my website. For example, when creating the site for my project, we discussed that UX/UI would greatly affect the users emotions. Specifically, I would like to make my website the easiest to navigate for someone that is already struggling, or maybe even frustrated, with drawing. I also want to make it a fun practice rather than a boring lesson. These additions are very important when considering the feelings of my users.</p>

    <h3>Black Hat</h3>
    <p>When my partner and I got into detail about things I would like to add to my website, it became a conversation of “realistic expectations.” I talked about some of the things I wanted to add like a beginner, intermediate, and advanced section for drawing in perspective but realized that maybe I was going in over my head. We discussed how simple and direct is better. Instead it could be a very beginner site for those fairly new to drawing in perspective.</p>

    <h3>Yellow Hat</h3>
    <p>This site will work and inspire other fellow artists. Using the black thinking hat, I can strategize a plan that will produce the best outcome for my site. A positive thing that we thought of would be to draw. I love drawing and for the purpose of this assignment, I could draw in perspective to better motivate me to create a positive feeling website. My vision is a modern website with perspective visuals in a scrolling experience. 
</p>

    <h3>Green Hat</h3>
    <p>We thought of many possibilities for my website design. We came up with ideas like including some of my personal drawings as either decoration for the website or maybe reference. We threw out crazy, more unrealistic ideas, like creating an interactive perspective grid where the user could take a shape and set the grid to one, two or three point perspective. Different variations of 3d shapes would be a nice addition as well. I explained how much of a green hat thinker I am because I tend to prioritize creativity and design above all else. Though, we did discuss just how important the other hats are and something I need to consider.  
</p>

    <h3>Blue Hat</h3>
    <p>My partner and I discussed how the blue hat or conductor is kind of similar to a project manager. Because I am doing this project by myself, I will have to organize and plan according to the amount of time I have left. We thought the best way would be to start creating a a brainstorming sheet including all things I want on my site, then creating a rough draft, have the professor look over, and then finalize changes to the draft. 
</p>
<h3> Realization</h3>
<p>
Through this discussion I have learned that my idea for the project is going to change especially when making it. I need to be more realistic because my expectations will be too complicated and advanced. I do realize that something nice can come out as long as I put the work in and deliver easy ux/ui to help drawing in perspective. </p>
